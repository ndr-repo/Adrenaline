# Adrenaline - Source Code Reverse Engineering Framework 
**Not another ```<a href>``` tag crawler.** 

Adrenaline matches URI paths via regex from source code and crawls the web application from matched paths. Banners are saved to ```Adrenaline/log/hrefTrace/:domainName```. 

Created to save time when performing black-box web application security tests & API reverse engineering. Great for testing proprietary or undocumented applications & APIs. 

For red/purple team operations, DevSecOps, & external penetration testing.
