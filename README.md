# Adrenaline - Source Code Reverse Engineering
**Not another ```<a href>``` tag crawler.** 

Adrenaline matches URI paths via regex from source code and crawls the web application from matched paths. Banners are saved to ```Adrenaline/log/hrefTrace/:<domainName>```. Created to save time when performing black-box web application security tests & proprietary or undocumented API reverse engineering. 

For red/purple team engagements, DevSecOps, & external pentesting. 
## Usage
```
python3 adrenaline.py <url-to-src>
```
